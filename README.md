# bullhorn #

Real-time notification dispatcher written in node.js

## Running The Service ##

To run the service locally in a production like environment, you'll need to
install VirtualBox and Vagrant. Once installed, you should be able to simply
type

```
vagrant up
```

This will build an Ubuntu 12.04 TLS server instance, install node.js, install
forever and then start the bullhorn server. Due to port forwarding, the bullhorn
instance will be bound to port 3001 on your local machine.

If you'd like to access the box to inspect log files or interact with the service,
type

```
vagrant ssh
```

When you're done, you can tear down the virtual environment with

```
vagrant destroy
```

## ReST API ##

The API for bullhorn can be broken down into the following categories and end point
functions. Every API function is versioned and requires that the client specify which
version using the Accept-Version header.

   - Process Info

 * Applications
   - Create New Key
   - Fetch Existing Key
   - Fetch Log Entries

 * Recipients
   - Save Recipient
   - Fetch Recipient
   - Delete Recipient

 * Notifications

### Internal Operation Info - Fetch Server Conf ###

This method is intended to be used by devlopers and operations staff to inspect
the server and configuration without the need for SSH.

#### Example Request ####
```
GET /_internal/conf
```

#### Example Response Body ####
``` javascript
{
  "bullhornVersion": "0.1.0",
  "cmd": "node /projects/bullhorn/app.js",
  "nodeVersion": {
    "http_parser": "1.0",
    "node": "0.10.26",
    "v8": "3.14.5.9",
    "ares": "1.9.0-DEV",
    "uv": "0.10.25",
    "zlib": "1.2.3",
    "modules": "11",
    "openssl": "1.0.1e",
  },
  "env": {
    "PATH": "/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/share/npm/bin",
    "TMPDIR": "/var/folders/xs/qc9tcp0n2yl16ph6j9cbcw180000gn/T/",
    "SHELL": "/usr/local/bin/zsh",
    "HOME": "/Users/dhable",
    "USER": "dhable",
    "LOGNAME": "dhable",
  }
}
```

The body details of the nodeVersion and env modules are fetched directly from the
node.js process object. The details can vary depending on the configuration of the


### Internal Operation Info - Process Info ###

This method is intended to be used by developers and operations staff to view the
current process info for the server without the need for SSH.

#### Example Request ####
```
GET /_internal/top
```
#### Example Response Body ####
``` javascript
{
  "cmd": "node /projects/bullhorn/app.js",
  "pid": 5523,
  "uptime": 13353,
  "memory": {
    "rss": 39161856,
    "heapTotal": 30107392,
    "heapUsed": 13925568
  }
}
```


### Application - Create New Key ###

Notifications need to be associated with an application and that application can be
determined from the API key and API secret. These values are generated by the bullhorn
server.

#### Example Request ####
```
POST /keys
```

#### Example Request Body ####
```
organization=123&application=abc
```

#### Example Response Body ####
```javascript
{
   "key": "kj99dmldwlkmlkdmw",
   "secret": "kj99dmldwlkmlkdmwkj99dmldwlkmlkdmwkj99dmldwlkmlkdmwkj99dmldwlkmlkdmw"
}
```


### Application - Fetch Existing Key ###

Retrieve the current keys for use with an existing organization and application. This call
does not change their values.

#### Example Request ####
```
GET /keys/123/abc
```

#### Example Response Body ####
```javascript
{
   "key": "kj99dmldwlkmlkdmw",
   "secret": "kj99dmldwlkmlkdmwkj99dmldwlkmlkdmwkj99dmldwlkmlkdmwkj99dmldwlkmlkdmw"
}
```


### Application - Fetch Log Info ###















### Send Notification ###

This method acutally sends a notification based on the best choice for a user
at that moment. The details of which method is the best for the notification
are encoded in the bullhorn routing rules.

#### Example Request ####
```
POST /notification
```

#### Example Request Headers ####
No specific headers.

#### Example Request Body ####
``` javascript
{
  "to": [
    {"type": "user", "id": "c98fbf4b-0d69-4df8-916d-1cce99a5ca15"},
    {"type": "org", "id": "3bd68a34-0a65-4cd1-a435-ac7df866ff94"},
    {"type": "email", "id": "ops@jetway.io"}
  ],
  "msg": "Hey, something cool happened.",
  "template": "v1_notification"
}
```

The to parameter is an array of recipient. Each recipient is an object literal that
can contain two properties - type and id. Type is a hint to bullhorn which data source
it should use to look up the id with. The id is the primary identifier for the recipient.
Valid types include: user, org, email, or sms. In all cases, you should try to address
recipients using the user or org id instead of a raw SMS number of email address. currently
supported types are user, email, sms and web. Org support is currently not planned.

The msg parameter is the details of the notification that is being sent. Different
drains can shorten or format the message as appropriate for their use.

The template parameter is optional and defines if the message should be placed
inside of a larger template when sending. This will only be used if it's supported
by the particular drain.

#### Example Response Body ####
No body content is returned.

HTTP/200 indicates that the notification was passed off successfully to the
outbound notification system successfully (SMS provider / email provider / etc).

HTTP/404 indicates that the org defined in the message is suspended or does
not exist.

HTTP/400 indicates that the request was not formatted correctly or required
fields are missing.

HTTP/500 indicates that shit went south and bullhorn was unable to fulfill the
request. Error was probably bullhorn's fault.

## socket.io API ##

The socket.io API is contains two events that clients need to handle in order to start
using the open WebSocket connection as a potential notification channel.

### Connecting ###

After importing the socket.io JavaScript library, the client needs to open a connection
to the server on the /notifications namespace.
``` javascript
var notification = io.connect("http://<server address>/notifications");
```


### Registerting for Notifications ###

Once a connection is established, the client needs to identify itself with the user's
GUID. Without this identification, bullhorn won't be able to use this anonymous socket
and will disconnect after a short time.

To identify the socket, emit an event called "announce" which user is on the other end of
the socket and what version the client is programmed against. Since the connection could
be broken due to network hiccups, it's recommended to always emit the id event on connection.

``` javascript
notification.on("connect", function() {
  notification.emit("announce", {user: "...", version: "0.1.0"});
});
```
After emitting the id event, the client can just wait for notification events.


### Handling Notifications ###

All notifications are sent from the server on a "notification" event. The actual text
of the notification is sent as the data associated with the event. The client then just
needs to connect rendering/alerting code to the event. No reply needs to be sent.

``` javascript
notification.on("notification", function(msg) {
  // You'd probably want to do something more elobrate than a standard
  // alert box. This is just for demonstration purposes.
  alert(msg);
});
```
